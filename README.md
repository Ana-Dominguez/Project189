Unfortunately we could not include our data file in our submission because it was too large. The data is from this link on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/data
We had a last minute issue with our model code and it is giving us different model values. However, our conclusions are the same, our model did not have enough data in order to have high accuracy.
